“Nowadays,” complained Mr. K., “there are innumerable people who boast in public that they are able to write great books all by themselves, and this meets with general approval.
When he was already in the prime of life the Chinese philosopher Chuang-tzu composed a book of one hundred thousand words, nine-tenths of which consisted of quotations.
Such books can no longer be written here and now, because the wit is lacking.
As a result, ideas are only produced in one's own workshop, and anyone who does not manage enough of them thinks himself lazy.
Admittedly, there is then not a single idea that could be adopted or a single formulation of an idea that could be quoted.
How little all of them need for their activity! A pen and some paper are the only things they are able to show!
And without any help, with only the scant material that anyone can carry in his hands, they erect their cottages!
The largest buildings they know are those a single man is capable of constructing!”
