When things around me seemed once more to be real, Arthur was saying ›I'm afraid there's no help for it: they 'must' be finite in number.‹
›I should be sorry to have to believe it‹, said Lady Muriel.
›Yet, when one comes to think of it, there 'are' no new melodies, now-a-days. What people talk of as ›the last new song‹ always recalls to 'me' some tune I've known as a child!‹
›The day must come—if the world lasts long enough—‹ said Arthur, ›when every possible tune will have been composed every possible pun perpetrated—‹ (Lady Muriel wrung her hands, like a tragedy-queen) ›and, worse than that, every possible 'book' written!
For the number of 'words' is finite.‹
›It'll make very little difference to the 'authors'‹, I suggested.
›Instead of saying ›what book shall I write?‹ an author will ask himself ›'which' book shall I write?‹ A mere verbal distinction!‹
Lady Muriel gave me an approving smile.
›But 'lunatics' would always write new books, surely?‹ she went on.
›They 'couldn't' write the sane books over again!‹
›True‹, said Arthur.
›But their books would come to an end, also.
The number of lunatic 'books' is as finite as the number of lunatics.‹
