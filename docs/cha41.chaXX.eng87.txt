Louis XIV, wanting a portrait of the Duke of Burgundy to send to Spain, commissioned Coypel to do it, and wanting a copy for himself, charged Coypel to produce a facsimile.
Exhibted in a agallery at the same time, it was impossible to differentiate between the two paintings.
Louis XIV, foreseeing the dilemma he would find himself in, took Coypel aside and said, "It is not meet that I be mistaken in this instance.
Tell me which painting is the original." Copyel pointed out the original and a while later Louis XIV said, "The copy and the original are so similar that one could easily confuse the two; but with a little attention one can see that this painting is indeed the original."
