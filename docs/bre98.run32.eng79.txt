As far as radio’s aim in life is concerned, it cannot in my opinion consist in merely embellishing public life.
Nor does radio, in my opinion, suffice as a method of making the home cosy and family life possible again so we can cheerfully leave aside the question whether what it cannot achieve is in any case desirable.
But quite apart from its dubious function (to offer a lot is to offer no one anything), radio is one-sided when it should have two sides.
It is a pure instrument of distribution; it merely hands things out.

And now to be positive, that is to say, to turn to the positive side of radio, here is a proposal to give radio a new function: Radio should be converted from a distribution system to a communication system.
Radio could be the most wonderful public communication system imaginable, a gigantic system of channels — could be, that is, if it were capable not only of transmitting but of receiving, of making the listener not only hear but also speak, not of isolating him but of connecting him.
This means that radio would have to give up being a purveyor and organise the listener as purveyor.
That is why it is extremely positive when radio attempts to give public affairs a truly public nature.
But it is no task of ours to renew ideological institutes by innovations on the basis of the present social system rather our task is to move its basis through our innovation.
