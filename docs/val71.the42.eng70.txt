There is a story Stéphane Mallarmé used to tell, in amazement loaded with irony, of having watched a show in some London music hall that drew large crowds every evening.
The management merely hired a family to spend their evening before the public, exactly as they would at home.
They drank tea, chatted about the things they had done that day, discussed household matters, and possibly aired some of the topics they had read about in the newspaper: the gist of lift itself.
Afterward, everybody went home to bed satisfied.
And why not?
I am certain that a film whose scenario recapitulated the most uneventful day of the most prosaic person alive, simply showing him pursuing his life from morning till night, would be succesful.
