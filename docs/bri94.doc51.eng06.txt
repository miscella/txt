While the book, originally issuing from the leaf, presently tends to burst in its constitutive elements because of the need for mobility, other documentary forms appear through modern inventions and enrich the collection of human tools thanks to documentographies [Note: Neologism. “Documentography is the enumeration and description of diverse documents,” chapter II]. One ist no longer content with the book, with the printed fragment, the review article, the newspaper clipping, the archival copy. One transfers an entire work with its illustrations onto micro­films, microfiches, and onto “microcards.” A thick binder, microfilmed, can fit into a vest pocket. An entire library is contained in a handbag.

Still, the tools of intellectual work have deeply transformed the attitude of the scholar, whatever his specialty may be. The factors of space and time intervene much more than in the past. The hourly calendar, the telephone, the microfilm reader, the typewriter, the Dictaphone, and the teletype give to intellctual work a 'different rhythm'.

Documentation, while it is intimately tied to the life of a team of workers or scientists or scholars—or while it participates in an industrial, commercial, administrative, teaching activity, etc., can in certain cases end in a gen­uine 'creation', through the juxtaposition, selection, and the comparison of documents, and the production of auxiliary documents. The content of doc­umentation is, thus, inter-documentary.

Microfilm brings to the scientific researcher in his laboratory, onto his writing table, the document itself, as a small volume and in its entirety.
